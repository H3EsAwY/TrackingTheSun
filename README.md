## Project Overview

Our project, "Tracking The Sun: An Innovative Dual Axis Solar Tracker With Enhanced Weather Monitoring," aims to improve the performance and efficiency of solar panels by utilizing a dual-axis tracking system to follow the movement of the sun throughout the day. The project involves both hardware and software components. and some mechincal parts design as well.
